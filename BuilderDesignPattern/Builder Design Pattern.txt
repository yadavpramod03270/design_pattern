//=================================================Builder Design Pattern===============================================================

1)Real world Analogy Example:
Ordering a Burger at McDonald’s
You don’t say:
“Give me bun=true, patty=true, cheese=false, lettuce=true…”

You say:
Choose bun
Add patty
Add cheese (optional)
Add sauces
Step-by-step.
Same burger process → different burgers.
That is Builder.

2)Structure of Builder Pattern
   4 Main Roles::
   ---------------
  Product – The object being built
  Builder interface – Steps to build
  Concrete Builder – Implements steps
  Director (optional) – Controls order

===============================================================================================
When SHOULD You Use Builder?

Use Builder when:

Object has many optional fields
Construction must follow specific steps
You want immutability
Telescoping constructors appear
Same steps create different versions
