//=================Factory Design Pattern===================

1)" Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses (or a factory class) decide which class to instantiate."
2)"Factory Pattern centralizes object creation and hides the exact class being instantiated from the client."
3) example; 
   a)Client says: “I want a Vehicle”
   b)Factory decides: “Car or Bike or Truck?”
   c)Client never uses new Car() directly.
   
4)What if Factory Not Usage:
   a)Tight coupling to concrete classes
   b)Every new type = modify client code
   c)Violates Open–Closed Principle
   d)Messy, untestable, fragile
   
5)With Factory (Good design)
  Benefits:
   a)One place for creation logic
   b)Client depends on abstraction
   c)Easy to add new types
   d)Cleaner & scalable

====================================================================================================
1)When SHOULD You Use Factory Pattern?

Use Factory when ANY of these are true 

you see new scattered everywhere
Object type depends on runtime input
You want to hide implementation details
You expect new types in future
You want to follow DIP + OCP

MOST IMPORTANT PART
How to THINK: “This is Factory Pattern problem”
Whenever you see a problem, ask these questions:
Problem Thinking Checklist

1) Are there multiple related classes?
(Car, Bike, Truck)

2) Does client only care about behavior, not type?
(drive(), not Car or Bike)

3) Is object creation decision dynamic?
(User input, config file, API response)

4) Will new types be added later?
(New vehicle, new payment, new file type)

If YES to 2 or more → Factory Pattern
