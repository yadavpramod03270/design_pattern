//**************************Proxy Design Pattern***************************************************

Both Proxy and Adapter may look identical structurally and both follow DIP. 
The difference is intent: Proxy introduces an optional control layer over an already compatible object,
while Adapter is required to translate an incompatible interface so the system can function.”
Final crystal-clear comparison 
-----------------------------------
Proxy:->
Extra class exists for control
Real object is already usable
Removing proxy → system still works
Interface does not change
Intent: guard / delay / monitor

Proxy = optional middleman
-----------------------------------
Adapter:->

Extra class exists for compatibility
Real object is NOT usable directly
Removing adapter → system breaks
Interface is translated
Intent: make incompatible things work
Adapter = mandatory translator
One-line rule-->
Proxy protects something usable.
Adapter fixes something unusable.

-----------------------------------
• We recognize patterns by intent, not structure
• Proxy has an extra class that stands in for the real object
• The system can work even without the proxy
• Adapter also has an extra class
• But without adapter, the system cannot work because it’s needed to make things compatible

Another version:-->

Adapter manipulates / translates calls so that an existing incompatible class can work with the client’s expected abstraction.

The adapter does not fix the abstraction —it bridges the mismatch between:
1)what the client expects
2)what the adaptee provides
