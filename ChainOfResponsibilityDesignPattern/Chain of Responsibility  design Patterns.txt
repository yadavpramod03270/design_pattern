//=======================================================Chain of Responsibility  design Patterns =======================================================
/*
1)Chain of Responsibility lets multiple objects handle a request, passing it along a chain until one handles it.
“I can handle this? No? Pass it to the next.”

2)Client sends request once
  Handlers decide:
  handle it
  or forward it
  Client is decoupled from handling logic.
Each handler has: A reference to the next handler

3)When SHOULD you think of CoR?
Ask yourself ->
Use CoR if:
More than one object can handle a request
Order of handling matters
You don’t want big if-else
Client shouldn’t know who handles request

4)How to RECOGNIZE CoR in code
Keywords:
“Pass request”
“Forward to next”
“If I can’t handle, someone else will”
“Approval / Validation / Middleware / Filters”

5)
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
