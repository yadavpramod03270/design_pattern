//=================Abstract Factory Design Pattern===================

1)"Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes."
2)"In Factory we were creating one product , but in Abstract Factory ..we are creating family of products"
3)If Factory = single shop
  Abstract Factory = shopping mall (multiple shops)
=============================================================================================
1)  4 Main Components
------------------
 a)Abstract Product A (Chair)
 b)Abstract Product B (Sofa)
 c)Concrete Products (ModernChair, VictorianChair…)
 d)Abstract Factory (FurnitureFactory)
 e)Concrete Factories (ModernFactory, VictorianFactory)
 
 
2) How to THINK: “This is Abstract Factory”
  Ask these questions:
  Are there multiple products?
  Are they related or must work together?
  Are there variants/themes/platforms?
  Does client want to switch entire set at once?
   If YES → Abstract Factory

This is exactly a tree structure
Root → Abstract Factory
Internal nodes → Concrete Factories
Leaves → Concrete Products

4)Composite verbs:
Add
Remove
Traverse
Operate
Process

Abstract Factory verbs:
Create 
Produce
Instantiate
Select variant

If your brain says “run something on all nodes” → Composite
If your brain says “choose one version/style/platform” → Abstract Factory
