//=======================================================Observer design Pattern==========================================================
//Also known as: Event-Subscriber, Listener
/*

"Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing"

1)Observer Pattern means:
"When one thing changes, many other things automatically get informed."

2)YouTube Example 
Characters in the story:
YouTube Channel -> Subject
Subscribers -> Observers
New video uploaded -> State change
Notification -> Update

3)
What happens in real life?
You subscribe to a channel
Channel uploads a video
You automatically get notified
If you unsubscribe, no notification

Channel doesn't call you personally
Subscribers don't keep checking again and again
This automatic notification system = Observer Pattern

4)
How to decide: "Should I use Observer Pattern?"
Ask yourself only these 2 questions 

Question 1:
Do many objects need to react when one object changes?

Question 2:
Do I want to avoid tight coupling?
If YES + YES → use Observer Pattern

5)

"If parent and children share the same interface -> Composite
If parent notifies children -> Observer"

6)
"At first glance it looks similar to Composite because of the collection,
but the intent is notification on state change. Since A is not a B and it notifies dependents, this is Observer Pattern."

7)
Composite = structure problem
Observer = communication problem

====================================================================================
The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class
so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. 

this mechanism consists of-> 
1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects .
2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list.

Now, whenever an important event happens to the publisher, 
it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects.

The publisher maintains a list of subscribers and knows which magazines they’re interested in. 
Subscribers can leave the list at any time when they wish to stop the publisher sending new magazine issues to them.


Application:
Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases
The subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to.


“Creating a Subject interface is good when multiple subjects or loose coupling is required. 
For a single concrete subject, it’s acceptable to skip it to avoid overengineering.”

Observer interface is mandatory
Subject interface is optional and context-driven
