//=======================================================Command design Patterns ==========================================================
/*
1)Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

2)One-line definition:
Command pattern turns a request into an object.
That’s it.
Instead of directly calling:
light.turnOn();
You wrap it inside an object:

Command* cmd = new TurnOnLightCommand(light);
cmd->execute();
Now the request itself becomes an object.

3)Why Is That Powerful?
Because once a request becomes an object, you can:
Store it
Queue it
Log it
Undo it
Redo it
Send it over network
Execute it later
That’s the real magic.

4)Real World Analogy
In a restaurant, the waiter writes your order on paper and gives it to the chef.
The paper acts as a command that contains all instructions.
The chef executes the order without talking directly to the customer. 

5) Structure of Command Pattern
It has 4 parts:
Command interface
Concrete Command
Receiver
Invoker
(Client wires everything)

6)Why command pattern?

Answer:
Decouples sender from receiver
Encapsulates request as object
Enables undo/redo
Enables queuing/logging
Follows Open/Closed Principle
That’s strong answer.

7)The Sender class (aka invoker) is responsible for initiating requests.
This class must have a field for storing a reference to a command object. 
The sender triggers that command instead of sending the request directly to the receiver.
Note that the sender isn’t responsible for creating the command object.
Usually, it gets a pre-created command from the client via the constructor.

8)Structure of the Code
Mapping Real World → Pattern
Real World  -> 	Pattern Role
Customer    ->	Client
Waiter      ->	Invoker
Paper Order ->	Command
Chef        ->	Receiver
Cook Meal	->    execute()
