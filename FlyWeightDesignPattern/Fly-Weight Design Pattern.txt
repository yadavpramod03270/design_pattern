//===============================Fly-Weight Design Pattern===================
/*
Main:---->A flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern used to optimize memory usage and performance 
When dealing with a large number of objects that share some common characteristics.


1)Use the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.
The benefit of applying the pattern depends heavily on how and where it’s used. It’s most useful when:

2)an application needs to spawn a huge number of similar objects
this drains all available RAM on a target device
the objects contain duplicate states which can be extracted and shared between multiple objects


3)How to Implement
Divide fields of a class that will become a flyweight into two parts:

4)the intrinsic state: the fields that contain unchanging data duplicated across many objects
5)the extrinsic state: the fields that contain contextual data unique to each object
6)How to Implement
Divide fields of a class that will become a flyweight into two parts:

the intrinsic state: the fields that contain unchanging data duplicated across many objects
the extrinsic state: the fields that contain contextual data unique to each object


7)The simplest possible definition
Intrinsic State:
Data that is SAME for many objects → stored INSIDE the object → shared

Extrinsic State:
Data that is DIFFERENT for each object → passed from OUTSIDE → not stored
That’s it. Nothing more.

8) Real-life example :
Pizza shop 
Intrinsic (shared)::
Dough recipe
Sauce recipe
Oven temperature

Same for hundreds of pizzas
Extrinsic (unique)
Table number
Customer name
 Different for each order

// Problem first (why Flyweight?)
// Classroom has 500 chairs
// All chairs have same design, color, material
// Only seat number / student changes
// Without Flyweight ->500 identical chair objects
// With Flyweight -> 1 shared chair design, reused 500 times
